We didn't discussed the exercise with anybody.

=  README for ex10 = Asteroids :P  =

==================
Description:
==================

We asked to create the game Asteroids using object oriented
programming.

About our Special shoot:
It shoots three torpedoes in three different directions.
It is a very powerful shot and therefore destroys the asteroids immediately.
Also it gives the user 500 points.

Decisions related to the program design:

1. About the special shoot:
We choose do not create a new class, but each special shoot it is
a list of 3 regular Torpedos. The alternative is to create a new class
of the special shoot, it is more elegant, but our choice was to use the
Torpedo class functions, that already exist.

2. About the game loop function:
We chose to create 3 assist function, that each one responsible each class.
_ship_game_loop()
_asteroid_game_loop()
_torpedo_game_loop()
It makes the code more elegant, but we could keep the smaller
function in the game loop main function, and then the user may
understand better the occurrence.

3. About the game loop function:
We debated whether to check the user input in the game loop function
or within the functions responsible for the particular operation.
Finally we decided to check the input within the small functions so the
game loop function is cleaner and more elegant.
The advantage of leaving the conditions in the game loop function is that
the user may understand better the occurrence.
