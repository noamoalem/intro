README for ex6 : wave files
=============================

==================
Description: Editing a wave file. This program include 3
different options to work with wave file. The first is to change
an exist wave file ( volume it up/down , low pass filtered it,
revers it and more...). The second option is to unit 2 wave files
to a new one and the thirds one is to compose a new tune.
the program allow the user to save the changes as a new file.

Our program contain a main function that repeat the editing over and over,
and ask if save the changes every time, until the user ask to get out.
We chose to divide it to 3 another function (change_wav , union_file
and compose_tune ) and a function that ask for the necessary input and
check if it valid.
The 3 function have some assist functions each one that makes
the code readable and easier to understand. The chang_wav function have 6
assist functions that each one makes different change in the wave file.
if the file didn't save we choose to print message that telling the user
about it.
