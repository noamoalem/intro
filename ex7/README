= Description: =
======================
we asked to write 10 recursive function

======================
= Special Comments =
======================
RUNNING TIME:
is_prime:
The running time is O(√n), because this function use the function check_prime
and the worst case of check_prime is √n ,because of the if n < d * d.

print_no_repetition_sequences:
The running time is O(n*len(char_list)), because the maximum of combination we
can have is in the len of char_list and each one of them is in the len of the
number n. so the recursive call will happen len(char_list) times and the
operation + will happen n times.

flood_fill:
assuming the size of image is n x m (r - rows, m - columns).
The running time is O(n x m), because the worst case is that we need to fill
with * (n-1)(m-1) places, that is (nm-n-m+1) and if n,m are very big we can
ignore the rest and get the running time is O(n x m).
